-> Problems with polynomial running time O(pow(n,k)): Tractable (easy to handle)
-> Problems with no polynomial running time : Intractable (hard)
-> Problems whose status is unknown : NP-Complete
   -> No polnomial running algo is yet known
   -> But none such exist is not proven

Class P : Solvable in polynomial time
Class NP : Verifiable in polynomial time. P is susbet of NP
Class NP-Complete :
