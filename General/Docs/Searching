Problem: Generating m randon integers between [0,max)

 Array : 
   Move to right place and shift all integers after that to right. Put the new value in hole

 List  : 
    Move to right place and place the new number being adjusting next pointers.  Even though list does half work, it is slower due to:
     - take twice as much memory (next pointer). 8 bytes read into cache to access 4 byte number
     - Array uses contiguous memory. List nodes are random in memory  
       * Is list access in RAM slower than array?

 
 Space allocation:
    - allocate memory as group at begining as opposed to allocating for each node. Speeds up program.
