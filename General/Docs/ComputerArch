-> Tge memory hierarchy

-> Typically 4/8 KB is smallest page size available
   -> in 32 bit address space: 2 10bits each for two phases of virtual tp physical memory translation, and remaining 12 bits for pages, hence 4k size
-> x86 architecture can support page sizes above 1 MB, if it has Page Size Extension
