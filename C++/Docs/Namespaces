Traditional C++ namespace
-------------------------

==> Declarative region : Space where a declaration can be made. File, function, blocks, ...
==> Potential scope : From point of declaration to end of declarative region
==> (Actual)Scope : Potentual scope - any region where declration gets overshadowed 

==> New namespace features:
   --> Define new declarative region using names namespace
   --> Can only be defined in global scope and within on other namespace. Can not be in block
   --> External linkeage by default
   --> Global namespace : File level declrative region
   --> Namespaces are open : Can add names to existing namespaces
   --> Accessing names from namespaces : Scope-resolution operator "::". This is called qualified names.
