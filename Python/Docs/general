==> Variables and Objects:
   --> Variables are just name, they don't refer to a memory location. Instead they point to a object.
   --> The pointing from variable from object is done using pointer
   

-> Iteration tools:
   -> for loop
   -> in membership
   -> map
   -> list comprehensions

--> Iterable object: Any sequences:
   -> Physical : Stored physically in sequence
   -> Virtual  : produces one result at a time when called by iteration tool like for loop

--> Iteration protocol
   -> Any object with method "next"/"__next__" or produces a iter() object with next method
   -> raised StopIteration when there are no more objects

--> Depending on your Python and code, list comprehensions might run much faster than manual for loop statements (often roughly twice as fast) because their iterations are performed at C language speed inside the interpreter, rather than with manual Python code.


-> float('inf') -> max Infinite value
-> float('-inf') -> min infinite value

-> Integeres have infinite precision, while floats dont
